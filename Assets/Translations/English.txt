Weather change;
Global climate patterns are rapidly changing due to rising global average temperatures, raising the issue of using fossil fuels. The world will invest heavily in research and development technologies that do not use fossil fuels. These technologies will later aid in production activities when humans settle on alien planets.;
Environmental destruction;
The leakage of pollutants into the air, soil, and water has destroyed the natural environment and ecosystem. The world has placed the cause of the problem in plastics, which use fossil fuels as the primary raw material and are working to develop materials that can replace plastics. These efforts will aid in resource utilization when humans later settle on alien planets.;
Resource depletion;
Since the 19th century, human civilization has developed a form of relying heavily on fossil fuels. Still, as fossil fuels are being depleted faster than the speed at which they are formed, the problem of resource depletion has been raised. The world will strive to use natural resources and renewable energy. These efforts will help us use resources when humans later settle on exoplanets.;

When you start exploring, you can acquire land with minerals to be mined. Or you may encounter another country founded by your competitor.;
Adjust the planet's atmosphere to create the right atmospheric pressure. You can increase or decrease the amount of waiting by investing money. Atmospheric pressure affects a planet's temperature, water cycle, and carbon cycle. The ideal air pressure is 1013.25 hPa.;
Create the right temperature for life to settle. A planet's temperature affects the water cycle. Because the heat entering and leaving a planet is in equilibrium, the temperature change caused by the investment of money is temporary. The ideal temperature is 15â„ƒ.;
Water is essential for life to survive. Water in its liquid state allows life to begin to settle, while water in its gaseous state causes a temperature rise and has a negligible effect on the rise in air pressure. You can adjust the water volume to the ideal amount by referring to the graph.;
Carbon is a basic material for life and also a material for civilization. Investing money can control the influx of carbon into the atmosphere, but high concentrations of carbon entering the atmosphere cause a rise in temperature.;
You can invest your money to get seeds from the Earth. Organisms are affected by liquid water, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and the stability of the carbon cycle. Photosynthetic organisms produce oxygen.;
